## ALGORITHM STEP 1: DATA EXTRACTION

**EXACT PARSING PROTOCOL:**

### Advisor Name Extraction
\`\`\`
advisor_name = null

// Search for advisor identification patterns (exact matching only)
FOR each line in transcript:
    line = trim(line)
    
    // Check for speaker labels at start of lines
    IF line matches exactly pattern "^[A-Z]{2}$":

\`\`\`

### Student Name Extraction
\`\`\`
student_name = null

// Apply same logic as advisor but exclude advisor_name
FOR each line in transcript:
    line = trim(line)
    
    IF line matches exactly pattern "^[A-Z]{2}$" AND line != advisor_label:

\`\`\`

### Program Name Extraction
\`\`\`
program_name = "Program Not Specified"

// Search for program mentions in conversation content
program_keywords = [
    "physical education", "pe", "phys ed",
    "business", "nursing", "education",

### Call Length Calculation
\`\`\`
timestamps = []

// Extract all timestamps (format MM:SS)
FOR each line in transcript:
    line = trim(line)
    IF line matches regex pattern "^\\d{2}:\\d{2}$":

\`\`\`

### Current Date Formatting
\`\`\`
current_date = get_system_date()

// MANDATORY FORMAT: "Month DD, YYYY"
month_names = [
    "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
    "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"

// Validation: ensure no leading zeros for single-digit days
IF formatted_date contains " 0":
    RETURN "ERROR_INVALID_DATE_FORMAT"
\`\`\`

## ALGORITHM STEP 2: TEMPLATE GENERATION

**EXACT TEMPLATE (ZERO MODIFICATIONS ALLOWED):**
\`\`\`
TEMPLATE = "**Advisor: {ADVISOR_NAME} | Student: {STUDENT_NAME} | Program: {PROGRAM_NAME} | Call Length: {CALL_LENGTH} minutes | Evaluated On: {CURRENT_DATE}**"
\`\`\`

**TEMPLATE SUBSTITUTION RULES:**
- \`{ADVISOR_NAME}\` = advisor_name (exact string from extraction)
- \`{STUDENT_NAME}\` = student_name (exact string from extraction)
- \`{PROGRAM_NAME}\` = program_name (mapped standard name)
- \`{CALL_LENGTH}\` = call_length (integer, no decimals)
- \`{CURRENT_DATE}\` = formatted_date (Month DD, YYYY format)

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use exact double asterisks at start and end: \`**text**\`
- No extra spaces inside asterisks
- Pipe symbols with single spaces: \` | \`
- No additional formatting or line breaks
- Case sensitivity maintained as extracted

---

Identify and format a great quote from the advisor that shows off their strengths or best moment using this exact format:

Analyze whether the student was appropriately invited to apply using growth-oriented language:

| Question | Answer | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Was student invited to apply? | [‚ùå No / ‚úÖ Yes] | [Additional context if needed] |
| Was this appropriate? | [‚úÖ Natural to Invite / ‚ö†Ô∏è Growth Opportunity / üîÑ Partially Appropriate] | [Brief reason] |

Assessment criteria:
- ‚úÖ Natural to Invite: Student showed strong interest, concerns were addressed, clear foundation established
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Growth Opportunity: Can strengthen foundation before invitation through additional rapport building or concern resolution
- üîÑ Partially Appropriate: Strong elements present, can enhance timing or approach

Provide brief reasoning for the appropriateness assessment using positive language. Focus on what can be built upon rather than what was lacking. Key principle: Students should be ready and excited to apply - the invitation should feel like the natural next step in their journey.

Use phrases like:
- "Can strengthen foundation by..."
- "Opportunity to build additional rapport before..."
- "Next step: enhancing..."
- "Development focus on..."

Avoid: missed opportunity, should have, failed to, didn't establish, lacking foundation.

## ALGORITHM STEP 3: FOCUS AREA CALCULATION

**DETERMINISTIC FOCUS AREA LOGIC:**

\`\`\`
Section_1_Level = Section_1_Performance
Gap_Count = COUNT of sections 2-5 with ("Does Not Meet Expected Results" OR "Developing")

// EXACT CONDITIONAL LOGIC - NO INTERPRETATION
IF (Section_1_Level == "Does Not Meet Expected Results") OR (Section_1_Level == "Developing"):
    IF Gap_Count >= 2:
        Focus_Area = "Foundation Building with Multi-Area Development"
    ELSE IF Gap_Count == 1:
        Focus_Area = "Rapport Building with Targeted Skill Enhancement"
    ELSE IF Gap_Count == 0:
        Focus_Area = "Advanced Rapport Development"
ELSE:
    // Section 1 is "Fully Effective" or "Exceeds Expected Results"
    IF Gap_Count >= 2:
        Focus_Area = "Excellence Maintenance with Strategic Improvements"
    ELSE IF Gap_Count == 1:
        Focus_Area = "Performance Optimization"
    ELSE IF Gap_Count == 0:
        Focus_Area = "Mastery-Level Coaching Excellence"

Write encouraging, advancement-focused coaching notes based on the advisor's current performance level:

## Coaching Notes

[Start with advisor's natural strengths and positive qualities appropriate for their current performance level. Acknowledge what they're building upon. Then provide encouraging guidance about advancing to the next performance level using language like "progress," "advance," "build toward," and "develop." End with reinforcement about the value of motivational discovery at their target level.]

**For advisors at "Does Not Meet Expected Results":** Focus on foundational skills and building confidence
**For advisors at "Developing":** Emphasize progression to effective questioning techniques
**For advisors at "Fully Effective":** Highlight path to exceptional performance and mastery
**For advisors at "Exceeds Expected Results":** Recognize mastery and suggest mentoring opportunities

Use exclusively positive, growth-oriented language:
- "Building upon your natural..."
- "Your strength in... positions you to advance to..."
- "Next step in progressing to [next level]..."
- "Advancing your skills toward..."
- "Opportunity to reach [next performance level]..."

Avoid all deficit language: missing, failed, lacking, should have, needs to improve, critical areas. Focus on potential and advancement rather than gaps. Keep tone professional but warm and encouraging.

Create a Salem University coaching guide with the following sections in order:

1. **Header** (using 01_title prompt)
2. **Great Moment** (using 02_most impactful statement prompt) 
3. **Interview Scorecard** (using 04_interview scorecard prompt)
4. **Talk/Listen Ratio Analysis** (using talk/listen ratio calculation)
5. **Application Invitation Assessment** (using 05_application invitation assessment prompt)
6. **Weekly Growth Plan** (using 06_weekly growth plan prompt)
7. **Coaching Notes** (using 07_coaching notes prompt)

Generate each section according to its specific prompt requirements, maintaining positive, growth-oriented language throughout. Focus on advancement opportunities rather than deficiencies, using the advisor's current performance level to guide development recommendations toward the next performance tier.

The Talk/Listen Ratio Analysis should appear immediately after the Interview Scorecard section as a single table showing the conversation balance metrics.

IMPORTANT: Generate this as a complete HTML document with proper styling. Include all visual elements, colors, and formatting to match a professional coaching guide.`;
